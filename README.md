Data Analysis Class-Portfolio
Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in an unprecedented way, with millions of people infected and hundreds of thousands of deaths. As the pandemic continues, governments and public health officials are focused on strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus, including vaccination campaigns.

Research Topic:
The aim of this research is to examine the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and new cases of COVID-19. Specifically, we will explore whether countries with higher vaccination rates have experienced lower rates of new COVID-19 cases.

Data:
We will be using cross-national time-series data on COVID-19 cases and vaccinations, obtained from the Our World in Data project. The data covers more than 200 countries and spans from early 2020 to present.

Approach:
We will begin by cleaning and processing the data, selecting relevant variables and dropping missing data. Next, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. Finally, we will use regression analysis to test the hypothesis that higher vaccination rates are associated with lower rates of new COVID-19 cases, while controlling for other relevant variables such as population density.
